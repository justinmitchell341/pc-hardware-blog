# Graphical Processing Unit
The most important component for a photo or video editor, an engineer, or a gamer. It dictates the performance of graphically intensive software.
## AMD

Amd has only recently began making waves in the GPU market but they have come out swinging. Most recently they have released the 7000 series of GPUS which have the best cost to performance ratio of any graphics card right now.
## NVIDIA

Nvidia has been the king of the GPU market for a long time. They have been the go to for gamers and professionals alike. They have recently released the 40 series of GPUs which are a small step up from the previous generation. Though they still hold the majority of the market share.
## Software
Part of the reason Nvidia has been on top of the market is their software integration. They made optomizing for specific tasks easy with a great GUI. They had the most optimized and effective drivers. Most companies that built software or video games, built for nvidia. This is changing though. AMD has been making strides in their software and driver development. They have also been working with companies to make sure their software is optimized for AMD GPUs. More recently both of these companies have been delving into the realm of AI to assist with their products. Nvidia has been working on AI upscaling for video games and AMD has been working on AI assisted rendering for 3D modeling. Both of these companies are making great strides in the GPU market and it will be interesting to see where they go from here. Both companies have a AI driven software that filters out background noise from your microphone. Nvidia has RTX voice and AMD has AMD Noise Suppression.
