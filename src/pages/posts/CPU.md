# Central Processing Unit
The CPU is the main brain of a computer. It is responsible for all of the calculations and logic that a computer does.
## AMD

Amd has only recently exploded into the cpu market. As a company, headed by engineer Lisa Su, AMD has completley turned around their reputation when it comes to processor. They are now competitive and argulaby better than their competitor Intel, especially when an AMD Cpu is paired with and AMD GPU. This allows for a technology called Smart Access Memory which allows the CPU to access the entire VRAM of the GPU. AMD has recently released a the 7000 series of CPUs which, similarly to their GPU's, has some of the best cost to performance ratio.
## Intel

Intel has been the king of the CPU market for a long time. They have been the go to for gamers and professionals alike. They have recently released the 14th generation of CPUs which are a tiny step up from the previous generation. Though they still hold the majority of the market share. Intel is falling behind AMD generation to generation due to their unwillingness to push large changes to their architecture. They have been using the same architecture for the past 5 years and have only made small changes to it. This has allowed AMD to catch up and surpass Intel in terms of performance and cost to performance.
